Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. This compares the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time) most common month most common day of week most common hour of day

2) Popular stations and trip most common start station most common end station most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3) Trip duration total travel time average travel time

4) User info counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
chicago.csv new_york_city.csv washington.csv

### Credits
I used knowledge about Python programming I learned from Data Science Programming classes by Udacity.
