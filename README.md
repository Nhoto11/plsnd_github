### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I have used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I have written this program to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
