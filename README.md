GitHub project (Project 3) repository for PDSND

From Udacity:
     "Overview
      In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”
      Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
      You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

    What Software Do I Need?
      To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

      You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
      A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
      A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)."
      
    Data in CSVs
      Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
      End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
      Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
      Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
      End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
      User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

      The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

      Gender
      Birth Year

This project required us to use try/excepts, as well as, while loops to handle bad user inputs.

The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning python executable that could analyze the three Cities bikeshare data csv quickly and accurately.
The program allows the user to filter the data by city, month, and even day of the week. 

The program is setup to deal with potential input issues, it also allows the user to view raw data, and restart the program immediately after completion.
