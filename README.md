### Date created
The bikeshare_python_final.py file was created on 10-10-2019.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis across three major US cities

### Description
The objective of this project was to allow students enrolled in the Nanodegree program to conduct data analysis using Python in a user interactive manner. Students learned to apply essential python tools such as while and for loops, functions, etc to investigate a bikeshare database containing information about users in Washington DC, New York and Chicago. By the end of the project, those utilizing this python file would be able to query the database to find information for a specific city on a specific day regarding riders and their preferences.

### Files used
The files used to create this project were provided by Udacity. They included a bikeshare.py file which contained guidance for the project. They also provided .csv files for each city which contained all the data that needed to be queried.
