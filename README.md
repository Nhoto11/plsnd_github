### Project Title
Udacity-GitHub Bike Share Project

### Description
In this project, I wrote Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Contains a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present statistics.

### Files Used
Files used include bikeshare.py, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv files.

### Credits
The GitHub Project 3 repo for PDSND was used in this project.  

### Project Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

### The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
    Gender
    Birth Year

### Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day

### 2 Popular stations and trip

    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3 Trip duration

    total travel time
    average travel time

### 4 User info

    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
