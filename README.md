### Project Title
 My project title is Bikeshare
### Description
In this project, I explored data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I  wrote a code to import the data and answer questions. It also includes a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
