### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In the US, bikes(bicycle) sharing platforms have gained momentum and popularity. It gives users the freedom to rent bikes as needed and all for a very low price. In short one bike can be rented by multiple users in any given day.

In this project we will use bike share data from Motivate from three cities- Chicago, New York City and Washington to gain insights related to bike share utilization and patterns. We will write a python code to run commands and compute statistics using numpy and pandas to answer the following questions:

#### User Input
- Input city, month and day for which user wants Data
- Input for whether user wants to see 5 lines of raw data (continues till user enters "no")

#### Popular times of travel
- month which is most common
- hour of the day which is most common
- day of the week which is most common

#### Popular stations and trips
- start station which is most common
- end station which is most common
- trip from start to end which is most common (i.e., start and end station combination which is most common)

#### Trip Duration
- travel time (sum)
- travel time (average)

#### User Info
- each user type counts
- each gender type counts (data only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most frequent year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
