Feedback note -  I have made the required correction re user stats, thanks so much for the feedback, very helpful and useful for the future.  I will definitely check out the green tea, hacker earth and runestone links.  And if you can recommend any books, my preferred medium, at base/intro level as I feel like I am missing some fundamentals being much more of an accountant than programmer, I would very much appreciate.

It could just be too much (or too little) coffee on a Sunday morning, but I am having trouble following what you mean by filtering by month or day.  It already does that doesn't it?  Screen shots attached.

I do have a sequence issue however per screen shots.
So if you keyed for example 
chicago, january, monday, no, it would provide the answers as

1,2,3,14,4-13

instead of per below

1. most common month
2. most common day of week
3. most common hour of day
4. most common start station
5. most common end station
6. most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
7. total travel time
8. average travel time
9. counts of each user type
10. counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
11. earliest year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
12. most recent year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
13. most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
14. Offer to select raw data five lines at a time
 
Do you know how to correct this?
